# RealTimeBattle-Bot in Elixir

This is a template for a bot for RealTimeBattleBot (http://realtimebattle.sourceforge.net/) written in Elixir.

Use a fork of this repo to develop your own bot so we can have a nice tournament later.

Program your bot in this file `lib/your_bot.ex`.

## Setup

You need

 * Docker
 * A VNC Client
 * Some editor

After setting up docker, you can start the bot using `make start`

After that, you can connect to `vnc://localhost:5900` with your preferred VNC Client.

The password is `password`

macOS Users: you already have a VNC client! type `open vnc://localhost:5900` into your console after starting.
